	<h1>Time,Space,Complexity</h1>
<p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. It is a measure of the efficiency of an algorithm, indicating how the runtime grows with the size of the input. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, meaning they can handle larger inputs in less time.</p>
    <p>Space Complexity is another crucial aspect to consider when analyzing algorithms. It refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to execute as a function of the length of the input. Algorithms with a space complexity of O(n) means the amount of memory required grows linearly with the size of the input. <b>Space Complexity</b> analysis helps in understanding how much memory an algorithm consumes and how it scales with input size.</p>
